The SecureHealth-IoT-Auth repository is dedicated to implementing a robust and secure authentication protocol between Raspberry Pi devices and a SmartHealth Server. This project aims to enhance the security of medical data transmission in IoT healthcare environments. It features detailed implementation of TPM (Trusted Platform Module) interaction for attestation reports, secure network communication functions, and SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission. The repository provides code for establishing secure channels, handling device-to-server communication, and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality in healthcare IoT systems. It is an essential resource for developers and researchers working on secure IoT healthcare solutions, focusing on practical, hardware-based security approaches to protect sensitive health data against cyber threats.

## Constants and Configuration

```python
SERVER_IP = "120.12.12.12"
SERVER_PORT = 12345
TPM_VERSION = "2.0"


In this implementation, ssl.wrap_socket is used to wrap a standard socket into an SSL socket. The keyfile and certfile arguments specify the file paths to the private key and the certificate, which are necessary for establishing a secure TLS connection. This example assumes that the server is set up to handle SSL connections and that you have valid certificate and key files. Remember, for real-world applications, you should handle exceptions and errors appropriately, and ensure the certificate and key files are securely managed.

As secure_socket is the SSL-secured socket returned by the establish_secure_channel function. Data is read in a loop from the socket, and process_patient_data is a placeholder for the logic required to handle the received data. The recv method reads data from the socket, and the loop continues until there's no more data to read. Exception handling is essential to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during network communication.
